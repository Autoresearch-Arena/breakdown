## [0.0.2] - 03-November-2026

Author: Claude Opus 5.5 Medium

- What: Finalized the product and build spec after three reviews (Apple API check, physics check, fit with the Boss's ask).
- Why: Reviews found physics test errors, a determinism rule that contradicted itself, missing pocket and audio work in the first milestone, and a Part One question that was not a real decision.
- How: Applied the findings that held up; deployment targets moved to 26 so everything is testable here; milestone one split into 1a and 1b with a Step Zero.

## [0.0.1] - 02-November-2026

Author: Claude Opus 5.5 Medium

- What: Created the repository with the README, this change log, a Swift/Xcode ignore file, and the product and build spec in docs.
- Why: The Boss wants a native iPhone and Mac physics game. Pool comes first, with the table "melting" into the physics. Scan-and-smash with the iPhone's depth scanner comes later. The spec settles what we are building before any code is written.
- How: Four research passes (pool physics, Apple SDKs checked against the copies installed on this Mac along with a test build in the Simulator, game and physics-view design, scan-to-smash). One writer drafted the spec. Three reviewers checked it for Apple API accuracy, physics correctness, and fit with what the Boss asked for. A final pass applied their fixes.
